## Announcement Languages 

Announcement is generated in the below three languages:

* **Hindi**

* **English**

* **Gujarati**

## Development Environment

* Used **Python Language** with a **bunch of its libraries** like **pyAudio**, **pydub**, **pandas**, **openpyxl** and **gTTS** to **generate announcement status** of thousands of trains.

* Used **pyAudio** to play and record audio.

* Used **pydub** and **pandas** for audio manipulation.

* Used **openpyxl** to read excel(.xlsx) file.

* Used **gTTS(Google Text-to-Speech)** to translate text to speech.

## Process

* First of all record the announcement of any of the train from the railway station or download it from the internet.

* Then trim the recorded sound of the train number and name, source, route, destination, platform number on which train is arriving, and so on seperately.

* Maintain a database in excel sheet of various information regarding the train number and name, source, route, destination, platform number, etc.

* Read that excel file and convert all those text to speech according to the languages(Hindi / English / Gujarati) and create seperate audio files.

* And then finally merge that generated text to speech audio files with the trimmed audio files according to our database and name that combined audio file as Announcement_TrainNumber.

* At the last, delete all intermediate seperate audio files to free up the unnecessary space occupied.

## Conclusion

**The principle point of developing this is to give voice based announcement which requires less time to create the announcement and that too in various languages. This project can reach out to any number of stations. It is more efficient and convenient than the normal announcement.**
